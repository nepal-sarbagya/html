Our Beliefs<br><br><br>

For KMC, every child is special and has unique ability. Our approach is to respect the diversity and reach to each child for nurturing his/her to grow.<br>
The school is the place to ensure the child’s social, emotional, physical and intellectual development.
School should become data driven adopting best practices; hence we have to consider KMC as the learning institution.  It always goes for innovative ways to enhance capacity and skills of students and connect their learning to real life context.<br>
Teaching-learning at KMC is student-centered, focusing on hands-on activities for learning through experiences and guide them to construct their won understanding. The instructional activities also engage students up to critical and creative thinking.<br>
School is a place that provides foundation for “lifelong learning’, which is possible only if both, teachers and students work together in respectful, noble, and caring atmosphere. Students need to have freedom to express their feelings and share their creativities.<br>
Parent’s support and collaboration is important for creating positive learning environment for children.
